# Pharmaceutical News Monitoring System - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
A Python-based automated news monitoring system for pharmaceutical industry professionals that aggregates RSS feeds, classifies articles using AI, and generates summaries for relevant content.

## Objectives
- Monitor multiple pharmaceutical news RSS feeds automatically
- Classify articles based on predefined topics of interest
- Generate AI-powered summaries for relevant articles
- Store structured data for future analysis and reporting

## Key Features

### 1. RSS Feed Aggregation
- Support for multiple RSS feed sources
- Configurable feed URLs
- Parse RSS XML to extract article metadata (title, description, link, date)
- Handle feed errors gracefully

### 2. AI-Powered Classification
- Topic-based classification system
- Predefined topics including:
  - "Orphan Drug Designation"
  - "Interim analysis were positive"
  - "FDA Accelerated Approval"
  - "Clinical trial results"
  - "Drug approval"
  - "Safety concerns"
  - "Market authorization"
- Multi-label classification (articles can match multiple topics)
- Confidence scoring for classifications

### 3. Article Processing
- Fetch full article content from URLs
- Generate concise summaries using AI
- Extract key information and insights
- Handle different website structures

### 4. Data Storage
- JSON format for structured storage
- Unique filenames with timestamps
- Store in `/data` directory
- Include metadata: title, summary, link, topics, date, source

## Technical Architecture

### Components
1. **Feed Manager**: Handles RSS feed parsing and aggregation
2. **Classifier**: AI-based topic classification engine
3. **Content Processor**: Web scraping and summarization
4. **Storage Manager**: JSON file creation and management

### Dependencies
- `feedparser`: RSS feed parsing
- `requests`: HTTP requests for article fetching
- `beautifulsoup4`: HTML parsing
- `openai` or `anthropic`: AI services for classification and summarization
- `datetime`: Timestamp management
- `json`: Data serialization
- `pathlib`: File system operations

### Data Flow
1. Fetch RSS feeds → Parse articles → Extract metadata
2. Classify articles by topic using AI
3. For classified articles: Fetch full content → Generate summary
4. Store processed data as JSON files

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Set up project structure
- Create configuration system
- Implement RSS feed parser

### Phase 2: AI Integration

- Create storage system

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing
- Add logging
- Implement retry logic
- Create comprehensive tests

## Configuration Structure
```python
CONFIG = {
    "rss_feeds": [
        "https://www.fiercebiotech.com/rss/xml",
        # Additional feeds...
    ],
    "topics": [
        "Orphan Drug Designation",
        "Interim analysis were positive",
        "FDA Accelerated Approval",
        # Additional topics...
    ],
    "ai_settings": {
        "model": "gpt-4",
        "temperature": 0.3,
        "max_tokens": 500
    }
}
```

## Output Format
```json
{
    "id": "unique_identifier",
    "title": "Article Title",
    "original_description": "RSS description",
    "summary": "AI-generated summary",
    "link": "https://...",
    "topics": ["FDA Accelerated Approval", "Clinical trial results"],
    "confidence_scores": {"FDA Accelerated Approval": 0.95, "Clinical trial results": 0.87},
    "date_published": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "date_processed": "2024-01-15T12:45:00Z",
    "source_feed": "FierceBiotech"
}
```
